# JS Practice Problems

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository to your computer (if you're not familiar with how, I recommend Github Desktop)
2. Open this folder in VS Code
3. Open the terminal in VS Code
4. Type `npm ci` and execute it
5. Type `npm test` and execute it. You should see a message saying that there are several ignored tests.

Now everything is set up. In the problems/functions-1 folder, you'll find a JavaScript test file. That test file consists of a series of tests describing various functions that haven't been written yet.

To do the exercise change the relevant `xdescribe` to just `describe`, then run `npm test` to see the results.

You should see at least one test failure. That is intended.

Now it is your job to write the corresponding function to make the tests pass. Once you believe that your function is correct or close to it, run `npm test` again to see if it passes the tests.

The `npm test` command should give you output showing whether your function worked or not, and if it didn't, it should describe a bit about what was wrong with it.

Keep doing that until you've completed all the exercises.
